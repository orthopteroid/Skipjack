Arduino SX126x sketch for sniffing Meshtastic (no radiolib dependency)

This firmware uses continious-receive mode on the Heltec wifi lora v3 esp32 board to sniff Meshtastic packets without the use of RadioLib to initialize the chip. I'm indebted to many very generous folks that have shared their code and knowledge, many of which have shout outs in the code. Perhaps this code can be ported to other chips as well, or made into a full RX/TX Meshtastic node.

On boot, the firmware prints messages to the serial port. It starts with checks for the time-on-air for various packet lengths. This calculation uses fixed-point math and is a bit of a work in progress but is reasonably accurate (less than 10%).

```
msTimeOnAir tests (work in progress)
TOA25  481ms
TOA50  667ms
TOA99  1031ms
TOA150 1410ms
TOA200 1782ms
```

The code then determines the time-on-air for a small 16 byte packet to use as the polling quantum in the cpu main loop. This time is dependant upon the radio configuration, so it needs to be determined at runtime. Longer polling intervals might miss very short packets so we want to keep loop() as quick as possible.

```
Polling quantum 415ms
```

Now the intitialization of the SX126x begins. Each line printed here is the chip status <chip mode> <command status> (consult SX126x docs for details) the error code and the line for the message. There are asserts in the code to ensure that the chip does not get in a bad state. When an assert fails the line will be printed here.

You can see the chip mode proceeding from 2x (standby in 13 mhz oscillator mode) to 3x (standby in TCXO 33 mhz oscillator mode) to 5x (receiving mode). You can also see the chip starts up with an error condition, which according to the specs is normal if a TCXO is fitted. The code detects this condition and clears the error accordingly. All of this is described in the code with annotations that point to the specs.

Once the initialization is complete and the ISR is hooked, the display on the board begins to show results from a status stream coming from the interrupt service routine. The contents of this stream are a bit cryptic without reading the code but the contents basically say that preambles and packets have been received. In the case below it detected a Preamble, a Valid header and Received a packet of length 0x27, twice (Meshtestic does perform multiple TX on packets so this is normal):

At the same time the interrupt service routine is sending arriving packets that end up on the serial port via a stream (or a double buffer scheme in more up to date code). Each packet is printed starting with a * and ending with a newline.

```

The contents of these streams are specific to the SX126x implementation and what is done with them is specific to the target board - I'm fortunate that the Heltec I have can use the display and the serial port to show different things. I can also take the board mobile (without a serial port attached) and test my packet capture using just the display.
